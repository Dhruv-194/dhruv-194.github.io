# My Portfolio Website :

This repository has the source code of my developer website which I have built to tell the community about me and showcase my projects. All in all this is my portfolio website. No third-party plugins or templates were used in making of this website. Everything is hard-coded by me using online resources. 

## Tech-stack used :

The website is entirely built using basic HTML CSS and Bootstrap. A little bit of Javascript is also used which is embeded in the HTML file itself.
